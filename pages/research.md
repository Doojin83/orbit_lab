# The Need for High-Capacity, High-Efficiency Power Management Systems

In today’s smart world—ranging from smart homes and autonomous vehicles to healthcare wearables and drone delivery systems—data plays a central role. To realize these technologies, we must process and transmit an ever-increasing volume of data. This growth is further driven by high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI), which demand greater computational power and higher data quality.
As data processing scales up, so does power consumption. This leads to significant heat generation and challenges in maintaining system efficiency. Additionally, the trend toward smaller, more compact systems increases the demand for high power density solutions. Therefore, advanced power management architectures—capable of supporting large-scale, efficient, and dense power delivery, such as integrated voltage regulators (IVRs)—are essential for the future of smart technologies.
