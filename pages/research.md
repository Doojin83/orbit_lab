# Research in ORBIT LAB

## Research Overview

At ORBIT LAB, we pursue the vision of realizing all aspects of the world—intelligence, connectivity, health, and energy—within a single chip. The name ORBIT stands for One-chip Realization of Boundless Integrated Technology, reflecting our mission to explore the full potential of integration in semiconductor systems.
Driven by the rapid evolution of digital technologies—from AI and HPC to smart environments and biomedical systems—we focus on power and reliability solutions that are not only high-performing, but also efficient, compact, and dependable. Our research includes high-capacity and high-efficiency power architectures for data-intensive platforms, robust circuit design techniques for safe and accurate biomedical devices, and foundational technologies such as testability, power integrity, ESD protection, and PVT resilience.
Inspired by the stability and precision of an orbit, ORBIT LAB is committed to building scalable and sustainable semiconductor solutions. Through integrated and forward-thinking engineering, we aim to bring boundless functionality into a single chip—turning vision into silicon.


## Main Research Areas

### 1. High-Capacity & High-Efficiency Power Management Systems

In today’s smart world—ranging from smart homes and autonomous vehicles to healthcare wearables and drone delivery systems—data plays a central role. To realize these technologies, we must process and transmit an ever-increasing volume of data. This growth is further driven by high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI), which demand greater computational power and higher data quality.
As data processing scales up, so does power consumption. This leads to significant heat generation and challenges in maintaining system efficiency. Additionally, the trend toward smaller, more compact systems increases the demand for high power density solutions. Therefore, advanced power management architectures—capable of supporting large-scale, efficient, and dense power delivery, such as integrated voltage regulators (IVRs)—are essential for the future of smart technologies.

### 2. Reliable Power Design for Portable Biomedical Systems

Modern biomedical systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated, handling larger volumes of data while still requiring portability. This creates a growing demand for power solutions that deliver both high performance and high efficiency.
Because these systems directly impact human health, reliability is critical. Power solutions must therefore not only ensure energy efficiency but also meet strict standards for safety and accuracy. Research into optimized power architectures is essential to support the next generation of biomedical devices with robust, efficient, and dependable operation.

### 3. Building Trustworthy and Robust Chips

As semiconductor technology advances, ensuring chip reliability has become a fundamental requirement for delivering valuable and trustworthy solutions. To achieve this, multiple design strategies must be considered from the ground up.
Key research areas include Design for Testability (DFT) to enable efficient and accurate fault detection, Power Integrity solutions such as distributed LDOs to ensure stable operation under varying loads, and robust Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) protection to safeguard against environmental risks. Additionally, circuits that can compensate for Process, Voltage, and Temperature (PVT) variations are essential to maintain consistent performance across all conditions.
Building reliable chips is not optional—it is the baseline for innovation in a data-driven, connected world.
