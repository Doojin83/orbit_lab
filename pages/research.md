## Research Themes

At ORBIT LAB, we aim to push the boundaries of analog and mixed-signal integrated circuit design.

### üîã Power Management ICs
- High-efficiency low-dropout regulators (LDOs)
- Fully integrated DC-DC converters
- On-chip power delivery for AI/HPC applications

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Biomedical Applications
- Low-noise, low-power analog front-ends for biosignals
- Wearable health monitoring ICs

### üõ° Reliable Analog Circuits
- Radiation/temperature-tolerant circuit design
- Aging and fault detection mechanisms

We welcome collaborative projects and interdisciplinary exploration.
