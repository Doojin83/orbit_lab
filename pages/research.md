# Research in ORBIT LAB

## Research Overview

Our research focuses on advanced power and reliability solutions for next-generation semiconductor systems. As digital technologies evolve—driven by smart environments, biomedical innovation, and massive data processing—the need for efficient, compact, and dependable circuit design is more critical than ever.
We develop high-capacity, high-efficiency power management architectures for data-intensive applications such as AI, HPC, and autonomous systems. In the biomedical domain, we pursue reliable power solutions that combine energy efficiency with patient safety. We also study robust chip design through innovations in testability, power integrity, ESD protection, and PVT variation compensation.
By combining performance, efficiency, and reliability, our goal is to enable scalable and sustainable semiconductor solutions for a smarter and safer world.


## Main Research Areas

### 1. High-Capacity & High-Efficiency Power Management Systems

In today’s smart world—ranging from smart homes and autonomous vehicles to healthcare wearables and drone delivery systems—data plays a central role. To realize these technologies, we must process and transmit an ever-increasing volume of data. This growth is further driven by high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI), which demand greater computational power and higher data quality.
As data processing scales up, so does power consumption. This leads to significant heat generation and challenges in maintaining system efficiency. Additionally, the trend toward smaller, more compact systems increases the demand for high power density solutions. Therefore, advanced power management architectures—capable of supporting large-scale, efficient, and dense power delivery, such as integrated voltage regulators (IVRs)—are essential for the future of smart technologies.

### 2. Reliable Power Design for Portable Biomedical Systems

Modern biomedical systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated, handling larger volumes of data while still requiring portability. This creates a growing demand for power solutions that deliver both high performance and high efficiency.
Because these systems directly impact human health, reliability is critical. Power solutions must therefore not only ensure energy efficiency but also meet strict standards for safety and accuracy. Research into optimized power architectures is essential to support the next generation of biomedical devices with robust, efficient, and dependable operation.

### 3. Building Trustworthy and Robust Chips

As semiconductor technology advances, ensuring chip reliability has become a fundamental requirement for delivering valuable and trustworthy solutions. To achieve this, multiple design strategies must be considered from the ground up.
Key research areas include Design for Testability (DFT) to enable efficient and accurate fault detection, Power Integrity solutions such as distributed LDOs to ensure stable operation under varying loads, and robust Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) protection to safeguard against environmental risks. Additionally, circuits that can compensate for Process, Voltage, and Temperature (PVT) variations are essential to maintain consistent performance across all conditions.
Building reliable chips is not optional—it is the baseline for innovation in a data-driven, connected world.
